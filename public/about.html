<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a 3rd-year undergraduate student at Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology, deeply interested in learning new concepts and gaining practical experience in my field. I enjoy participating in academic projects, collaborating with classmates, and exploring opportunities that help me grow both personally and professionally. I’m excited about building a strong career foundation during my time at RIT.</p>

<p>When it comes to technology, I’m particularly interested in web development. I love creating websites and exploring how design and functionality come together to build great user experiences. I’m eager to enhance my skills in front-end and back-end technologies, and I look forward to working on real-world projects that challenge me and help me innovate.</p>

<p>Outside academics, I’m passionate about cricket. I love both playing and watching the game, and I’m an off-spinner and a bowling all-rounder. Cricket keeps me active, teaches me teamwork and discipline, and gives me immense joy. Balancing my studies and my passion for sports is something I value greatly.</p>
